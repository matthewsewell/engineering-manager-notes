# Hello World. I'm matthew...

If you just joined my team or if you have been working with me for a while, this README document will serve as a guide to understanding how I think about software, engineering, management, relationships and being human. Of course, If you've been working with me for a while, you've probably already picked up on a lot of this stuff but I think it's important to know where I'mcoming from and what it  actually is that I expect from you and from myself. If anything in this document is unclear, please let me know. It is, like life, a work in progress.


## Motivation for this document

Manager READMEs seem weird at first but they make perfect sense. In tech, most of us value communication, transparency and good documentation. Management is about human beings, relationshionships and, of course, values. If I value communication, transparency and good documentation, wouldn't it make sense that this is where we start? So, let's begin...


## My role

You may report to me, but a lot of my job is to serve you. I'm not as successful as I can be if you are not as successful as you can be. I want that for you. I want you to have success in your work life and in your home life. To do that, I need to create the best environment that I can to ensure your success. This means that I fill a couple of roles.

- As an ambassador for my team and the engineering team in general. I always need to ensure that our efforts are aligned with other teams and that we are all serving our mutual goals effectively.
- As a mentor. Trust me, you can benefit from my mistakes.
- As an advocate for good decisions. I believe all opinions should be heard and respected but I also know most of even the best decisions are compromises. I like decisions that are driven by data and known best practices but I also see the value in ideas that as truly disruptive.
- As an unblocker of your work. I think this goes without saying, but I need to remove obstacles that get in your way.
- As someone who holds us all accountable. This is really more about focus and making sure that the wheels stay on the cart.
- As an example. I will strive to be open, conscientious and focused. I will also fail at this from time to time but I will persevere in this.
