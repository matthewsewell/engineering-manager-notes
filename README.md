# Hello World. I'm matthew...

My personal pronouns are he/him/his.

If you just joined my team or if you have been working with me for a while, this README document will serve as a guide to understanding how I think about software, engineering, management, relationships and being human. Of course, If you've been working with me for a while, you've probably already picked up on a lot of this stuff but I think it's important to know where I'm coming from and what it  actually is that I expect from you and from myself. If anything in this document is unclear, please let me know. It is, like life, a work in progress.


## Motivation for this document

Manager READMEs seem weird at first but they make perfect sense. In tech, most of us value communication, transparency and good documentation. Management is about human beings, relationshionships and, of course, values. If I value communication, transparency and good documentation, wouldn't it make sense that this is where we start? So, let's begin...


## My role

You may report to me, but a lot of my job is to serve you. I'm not as successful as I can be if you are not as successful as you can be. I want that for you. I want you to have success in your work life and in your home life. To do that, I need to create the best environment that I can to ensure your success. This means that I fill a couple of roles.

- **As an ambassador** for my team and the engineering team in general. I always need to ensure that our efforts are aligned with other teams and that we are all serving our mutual goals effectively.
- **As a mentor**. Trust me, you can benefit from my mistakes.
- **As an advocate** for good decisions. I believe all opinions should be heard and respected but I also know most of even the best decisions are compromises. I like decisions that are driven by data and known best practices but I also see the value in ideas that are truly disruptive.
- **As an unblocker** of your work. I think this goes without saying, but I need to remove obstacles that get in your way.
- **As someone who holds us all accountable**. This is really about focus and making sure that the wheels stay on the cart.
- **As an example**. I will strive to be open, conscientious and focused. I will also fail at this from time to time but I will persevere in this.


## What I value most

I value conscientious action. I will elaborate a little more on this in the section about what I expect from you.


## What you can expect from me

I believe that the old maxim that “respect is earned, not given” is toxic. Respect can be earned back if it is lost, but the default human condition should be to respect others regardless of ethnicity, national origin, religion or lack thereof, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical characteristics or anything else  that is used to separate us -- just by virtue of being human. You can and should expect that I will show respect for you -- that I will do everything I can to ensure that you are in a respectful and safe environment. That respect manifests in the following ways:
- **I will listen to your ideas**, even if they are as bad as some of mine are.
- **I will work to ensure you have the tools to do your job**.
- **I will not micromanage you**.
- **I will be honest with you**.
- **I will always endeavor to help you succeed**.


## Personality quirks

I have really bad imposter syndrome. I know this and I’m working on it. This can make me a little defensive or self-critical sometimes but I get over it quickly. I pace a lot, too. It helps me think. I am also still very technical and have an obsessive need to code.

I also am really bad at calendars. If I set a meeting with you but forget to invite you to it, don't take it personally. It just means I was sitting alone in an empty video chat for a while before I caught on.


## What I expect from you

Conscientious action is what respect looks like in the wild.  I expect you to be respectful of those on your team, those on other teams, our users, our potential users...I think you get the picture. What do some of those actions look like?
- **Never throw a teammate under the bus**. They need to trust you and you need to trust them. If you have a disagreement, discreetly talk to them. If that doesn’t work, both of you should discreetly talk to me together.
- **You represent your team** to the rest of the world. Don’t make us look bad. Foster respect and good will among other teams and users.
- **Be on time**. Don’t mismanage your time at the expense of others.
- **Be transparent**. If you are struggling with anything, even if you are having personal issues, I need to be aware of how this might impact your work so I can plan around it. There is no danger in over-communicating but a lack of communication raises a lot of red flags for me.
- **Challenge me**. If I’m on the wrong path, I need to know it.
- **Treat the production environment as a holy thing**. Our users need to trust the systems we create. Don’t ship broken code in order to meet a deadline. If you find a bug in production, take ownership of it by fixing it and/or filing a ticket.
- **Speak up**. Your opinions matter.
- **Take chances and try new things**. In tech, complacency is death.
- **Maintain a healthy work/life balance**. The idea that you have to work 60+ hour weeks in tech is misguided. Working more hours just becomes a justification to be less efficient. I would much prefer you are sharp and focussed 35 hours a week than a zombie that works 70 hours a week.
- **Actively practice empathy**. A little goes a long way.
- **Ceremony is essential to community**. Even if you don’t feel you are benefitting from daily standups, know that the team benefits for all of us participating. Show up for your community.

## What can get you fired

- **Duplicity, deception, or otherwise having your pants on fire** Don't lie to me, your team, our customers, or yourself.
- **Damaging the team** We must be able to trust each other.
- **Damaging the product** We're relying on you to make the product better -- not worse. We all make mistakes, and that's OK. Just don't be willfull or apathetic about it.

## 1:1s

I value my time with you one-on-one very much. I schedule these meetings for a half-hour every week but I make sure to not schedule anything else after it so we can take an hour if we need to. In general, I like to do one-on-ones at the end of the week if possible so I can think about them over the weekend. If you need to talk to me this way at other times throughout the week in addition to that, just let me know.

I prefer these meetings to be in person if possible and minimally in a video chat. I like to see your face.

This is your time. I will ask you about your week and what sorts of things I can help you with, but you can bring up anything you want to bring up. If we go off topic and talk about philosophy or My Little Pony, that’s completely OK.


## After hours communication

I don’t work weekends or after-hours unless I’m up against a challenging deadline or have some emergency. **I don’t expect you to** either.

If there is an emergency, by all means, call me. 

If you send me any email over the weekend or after 6 pm, I probably won’t see it. If I send you one, I don’t expect you to read it. Same for slack.
